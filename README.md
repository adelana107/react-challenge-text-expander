## ðŸŽ¬ About This Project
This project was built while following a React tutorial by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/).  
I recreated the app to improve my understanding of React components, state management, and props.

## ðŸ§  What I Learned
- Using `useState` and `useEffect`
- Managing component state
- Passing props between components
- Conditional rendering
